# Provider Logo

When your courses are crawled by Classpert Bot, we end up showing them on [Classpert](https://classpert.com) in the search page, in course pages, etc. You'll see that there's a logo accompanying every course. This is the course's provider's logo.

If you want your logo to show up on Classpert as well, just add an image of your logo (preferably SVG but might be in JPG / PNG format) in the `Website Settings` section, under `Logo`.
