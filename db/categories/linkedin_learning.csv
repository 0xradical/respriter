To make the effect look natural, compositors also need a deep understanding of how to match color, light, and phenomena specific to the camera, including grain and depth of field. Matching requires no special knack; for example, you can learn to effectively match color even if you have trouble seeing color accurately. So join Mark Christiansen, as he teaches you how to composite 2D or 3D foreground objects to a background scene with After Effects and seamlessly match light, color, depth of field, and noise, so that every element looks natural.

For it to be effective, the key is in the details. In this course, Mark Christiansen shows how to produce feature-film-quality keys in After Effects that fit well within their new scenes, while retaining the subtle details—be they strands of hair or soft or translucent edges—that make the results believable.  
  
Beginning with a brief explanation of the keying process, Mark takes you through the steps involved in creating a perfect green-screen key: generating a rough matte, eliminating color spill and matte lines, and refining problematic edges. He shows how to work with Keylight and Primatte—two indispensable keying tools in After Effects—and explains when to use one over the other. And for times when green screen won't work, he shows how to generate high-contrast mattes, or luma keys, based on the luminance data in your footage.

Discover how to match the full conditions of the shot as the camera sees it, including back lighting, lens distortion, and other lens and frame-rate artifacts. To make a shot or sequence that belongs in your movie, you need to know how to flatten the shot so that you can use tools such as Magic Bullet Mojo or Looks to make it look truly cinematic. But even beyond making it flat, it's best for it to have the full depth and response of color as we see it in the natural world, and that requires the use of 32-bit-per-channel HDR. And for maximum drama, you want to be able to play with time itself, and motion blur as well.

With a dynamic range of films, from feature animation to comedy to silent films, this panel offers a diverse group of opinions and stories from the set. Gore Verbinski (_Rango_) was shocked that voice actors were recorded one at time, so he arranged for his ensemble cast to be recorded at the same time to take full advantage of the actors' comedic interactions. Michel Hazanavicius (_The Artist_) talks about the challenge of getting a black-and-white silent film made in the 21st century. Terry George (_The Shore_) tells how he found humor in the serious subject of the conflict in Northern Ireland. Chris Miller (_Puss in Boots_) leaves room for improvisation in his script with his three main characters, two cats and an egg. Jennifer Yuh Nelson (_Kung Fu Panda 2_) shares her darker moments during production, assuring a nervous studio (a year into production) that everything will work out—despite having nothing to show them. Paul Feig (_Bridesmaids_), discovering the brilliant performance of actress Melissa McCarthy in rehearsals, rewrote parts of the script to take better advantage of her comedic genius.  
  
All of the directors speak candidly about the importance of great casting, a strong story, and the ability to listen to their audience through prerelease testing.

Will Reiser (_50/50_) also turned a life experience, his personal battle with cancer, into a comedy starring his best friend Seth Rogen. Jim Rash (_The Descendants_) walks us through his process as he turned the book by Kaui Hart Hemmings into a film nominated for five Academy Awards®. Tate Taylor (_The Help_) was roommates with author Kathryn Stockett, who wrote the best-selling book; he finished the screenplay (and owned the rights) before the book was even published. Writer J. C. Chandor (_Margin Call_) wrote about the financial markets, having grown up with his father immersed in that world.

In this course, photojournalist Paul Taggart outlines the fundamentals of shooting a photo essay, from thinking about your story photographically to presenting your final photo story.

Inking is a crucial part of the process. It's one of the final steps, where lines are traced more intentionally and artists focus on dynamic lighting and shadows. These days, pencil drawings aren't always necessarily ""inked"" but sometimes digitally scanned and refined, resulting in the finished inked look typical of most comics. In this course, comic creator Ben Bishop shows two methods for finishing comics in Photoshop, using examples from his graphic novel, _The Aggregate_. Method 1 is the traditional approach. After carefully selecting his brushes in Photoshop, Ben begins the digital inking process. He carefully retraces his lines, adding line weight, halos, highlights, and shadows and texture. He even adds blur effects that give his comics a cinematic quality while also using positive and negative space to set the mood of the scene and create a compositionally pleasing page.  
  
Method 2 shows us how to turn finished pencil artwork into clean, seemingly inked artwork, ready for color and ready for print—without any additional drawing.

A vibrant spring green, for example, can be easy to mix, but hard to balance. The same is true for warm autumnal colors and the vivid blues of summer skies. Will shows how to build these palettes and use gestural impressionistic brushstrokes to paint different landscape scenes. By introducing washes and glazes, he demonstrates how to simulate the atmospheric light of each season. So break out your brushes and paints.

This is the premise of _Foundations of Graphic Design History_, a series aimed at designers, artists, and anyone else who wants to understand the history of design. In this installment, Sean Adams focuses on Arts and Crafts, a movement defined by a reaction against the industrial age and Victorian excess, and a renewed focus on the handmade.  
  
Sean reviews the factors leading to the rise of Arts and Crafts, and the designers and companies who led the charge, including William Morris, Gustav Stickley, and Frank Lloyd Wright. Since Arts and Crafts spanned more than print, Sean reviews its impact on architecture, textile and furniture design, ceramics and glasswork, and bookmaking. He also explains what led to the decline of the Arts and Crafts movement , and how its influence on contemporary design lives on.

For these organizations, spinning up a few agile teams is just the start. Eventually, they'll want to scale up their agile approach to work on enterprise-level products—a shift that presents a whole new set of challenges.

First, learn how to identify your organization's culture. There are many different types of organizational cultures, and each one presents its own set of challenges.

Her goal is to add more functionality to any space. In this _Start to Finish_, we watch Michelle remodel a home in San Francisco's East Bay to meet a growing family's needs while obtaining the US Green Building Council's rigorous LEED Platinum certification.   
  
Michelle starts by working with the homeowners to understand their goals: they want to preserve the quiet profile of the house, improve its light and flow, and reduce the family's environmental impact. She studies how the family uses its space, and creates 3D home renderings based on their conversations. She helps them select green materials, designs separate-yet-connected spaces for each member of the family, and integrates earth-friendly features like solar panels. In the last half of the video, we jump ahead to see the results of the remodel, which has become a living exhibit on sustainable design as well as a comfortable place for Michelle's clients to raise their family.
