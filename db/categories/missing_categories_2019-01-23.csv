https://www.fun-mooc.fr/courses/course-v1:ulg+108006+session01/about,Chimie : ouvrez les portes de l’enseignement supérieur !,France Université Numerique,physycal-science-and-engineering,[]," **A propos du cours**

 

Ce MOOC s’adresse aux étudiants qui préparent un examen d’entrée aux études de médecine ou d’autres sciences de la vie, aux futurs étudiants en chimie, pharmacie, biologie, géologie ou sciences de l’ingénieur. Il permet aussi de combler le plus rapidement possible des lacunes constatées au début de l’enseignement supérieur. Enfin, il permettra à toute personne curieuse de mieux comprendre le monde qui l’entoure, de découvrir les fondements d’une science passionnante.

 

Arrivés au terme de ce MOOC, les participants seront capables de relier les caractéristiques macroscopiques de la matière à son comportement atomique et moléculaire et maîtriseront les bases de la chimie quantitative. Un second MOOC, en préparation, leur permettra ensuite d’approfondir ces notions en découvrant les grandes classes de réaction chimiques, comme les réactions acide-base et d’oxydo-réduction.

 

**Format du cours**

 

Le cours comprend quatre modules. Le premier module sera accessible à la date d’ouverture du cours et les suivants seront ouverts successivement toutes les deux semaines.

 

Le premier module traite de la structure atomique et moléculaire. Le deuxième aborde la nomenclature et les réactions fondamentales de la chimie inorganique ainsi que la structure des composés inorganiques. Le troisième module est consacré aux concepts-clefs de la chimie quantitative tandis que le quatrième aborde les différents états de la matière, leurs propriétés et les lois qui les régissent.

 

Les activités proposées comprennent :

 
1. Des vidéos présentant de manière vivante et accessible les concepts théoriques
2. Des expériences filmées introduisant ou illustrant ces concepts
3. De nombreux exercices de difficulté et d’ampleur croissantes et des rétro-actions (feed-back)
4. Un forum de discussion
 

**Prérequis**

 

Aucun prérequis en chimie n’est demandé même s’il est clair que suivre ce MOOC après avoir suivi un cours de chimie d’enseignement secondaire permettra de consolider et d’élargir les bases déjà acquises.

- Brainstorming
- Ishikawa diagrams
- Kepner-Tregoe root cause analysis
- Fault tree analysis
- Component failure impact analysis
- Service outage analysis

Have you ever wondered what it means to be more strategic as a leader? What differentiates a leader from a strategic leader? Of course, this label can mean all sorts of things; some people seem to have started using it simply because it sounds good! But when it comes to leading an organisation, being \""strategic\"" does have a specific meaning. It is about ensuring that your organisation is fully focused on executing its business strategy. What does this involve exactly? How do you make sure that your organisation can deliver on the business strategy? This week you learn to understand the organisation as consisting of a number of elements: people, structure, culture, and systems. Each of these elements will be covered in depth in weeks 2-5 of the course. In this first week, you will take a broader perspective across them as a basis for understanding the importance of aligning them in such a way that they can enable the execution of the business strategy. This focus on alignment brings us to the central concept for this week: key capabilities. This week you will learn what key capabilities are, why they are so important for strategically focusing your organisation, and how you can identify them. If you learn to master the ability to clearly define a set of key capabilities for any given strategy, and are able to align your organisation to these, you will become a truly effective leader, worthy of the term \""strategic\"".\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 2**\n\n \n\nOrganisational culture\n\n \n\nWhat do you think is the most challenging aspect of making sure that your organisation can deliver on its business strategy? Many senior executives would definitely say: \""organisational culture\"". When your organisational culture works to support your business strategy it gives you a huge advantage; when it doesn't it can spell disaster. So what is \""organisational culture\"" exactly and what is so challenging about it? And how do you know if your culture is aligned with your strategy? These are some of the key questions that you will grapple with this week. You will learn to apply a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying your predominant culture type, and for assessing whether you should try to change it or not. You will also learn a number of important change levers that you can influence if you do decide culture change is needed. Be careful though! The road of culture change can be treacherous. This week you will learn how to navigate it better.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 3**\n\n \n\nOrganisational structure\n\n \n\nWhat would you do first if you wanted to fundamentally change the direction of your organisation? Well, if you are like most leaders, you would definitely consider changing the structure of the organisation. But when you dig a bit deeper into this topic, you will quickly discover that there are a huge number of structural options to choose from. So how do you know which option is best? What are the main types of organisational structure, and what are their advantages and disadvantages? How do you make sure that your organisation structure enables your business strategy, instead of making strategy execution more difficult? These are the key questions that you will engage this week. You will learn about the key trade-offs involved in organisational structure decisions, and how to balance these trade-offs in relation to your business strategy. And you will learn to apply a powerful 4-step process for developing an effective organisational structure for your organisation. Even if you are not in a position yet to directly influence the structure of your organisation, wouldn't it be great to at least know what the structure of your organisation should be, theoretically speaking? This week is focused on just that.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 4**\n\n \n\nOrganisational control systems\n\n \n\nWhat are systems for exactly? This can be quite a tricky question because it obviously depends on the particular system we are talking about. Yet, from a management perspective there is a straighforward general answer to this question: systems are there to control performance and risk. This week you will learn what this means exactly, and what the most important implications are for how you design your systems around your business strategy. You will learn to understand systems more broadly than just IT systems, and how to deploy them effectively to manage and control performance and risk. An important part of this involves deciding on the key indicators that you want to track, and how you want to report information that is strategically relevant. Too many business leaders drown in numbers to the point where they can't see the wood from the trees. This week is focused on helping you design systems that can keep you focused on seeing the wood instead of the trees.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 5**\n\n \n\nStrategic human resource management (HRM)\n\n \n\nIs it possible to manage your employees \""strategically\""? What does that mean, and what would it look like? The key principles of Human Resource Management (HRM) have been around since at least the 1950s. However, since the turn of the 21st century we have seen a distinct move towards making HRM more \""strategic\"". Amongst many other things, this has involved making the Human Resource (HR) function more pro-active, and highlighted its importance for the strategic success of companies. Yet, there is also another way of approaching HRM more strategically: determining what roles are strategically most important, and tailoring your HR practices accordingly. It is this specific approach to strategic HRM that will be the focus of this week. You will learn to question common practices in HRM from a strategic perspective, and develop alternatives to them that better support the business strategy of your organisation. You will also learn to apply a key conceptual framework for strategically differentiating your HRM approach. So this week is all about learning how to align your people practices with your business strategy. This will involve some tough, and possibly controversial choices, which should provide plenty of opportunity for some great discussions.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 6**\n\n \n\nFrom organisational alignment diagnosis to solutions\n\n \n\nThis final week of the course is all about bringing everything you have learnt over the past five weeks together in one powerful framework. This framework will help you move from problem diagnosis to solutions development, and will help you prioritise the key issues that your organisation should be focused on. You will revisit the central topics of this course – key capabilities, structure, culture, people, and systems – as a basis for deciding where the biggest sources of misalignment are in relation to your business strategy. And after deciding on your most critical issues you, will use the key frameworks in the course to develop a set of recommendations that could address these issues. You will then be encouraged to think through the risks associated with your key recommendations and develop risk mitigation strategies. All of this will culminate in a professional report with your organisational recommendations. Some tips on how to approach such a report will also be covered. When you have mastered the skill of determining what the most critical organisational issues that your business should focus on, you will be in a much better position to lead organisations effectively and strategically.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n"", ""workload"": 4, ""published"": false, ""subtitles"": [""en""], ""video_url"": null, ""course_name"": ""Organisational design: Know your organisation"", ""description"": ""When you become responsible for leading an organisation as a whole, your most important leadership challenge will be enabling your organisation to deliver on its strategy, whilst also ensuring that it remains sufficiently agile.

You will get to know our partner company and learn about current issues they are facing. Throughout the capstone project you are asked to analyze one of the consulting report questions posed by the company and write a report giving recommendations to the company. Your final report will be forwarded to the company. This week is supposed to give you the possibility to revise relevant content from the three courses in the specialization, to learn about the partner company and their questions and to get familiar with the capstone project and what is to expect in the upcoming weeks.  \n  \n**Milestone I – In-Depth Research**  \nIn this module you will focus on one of the questions posed by the company and collect relevant information for answering the question. You will learn how to work yourself through various sources of data and to evaluate their quality and relevance for the topic at hand. At the end of the module you have the chance to share your work by handing in a three-page description of your method, sources and key findings. This is an optional peer reviewed assignment and it will not count towards the final grade. However it presents a great opportunity for you to receive feedback and improve your industry project.  \n  \n**Milestone II - Analysis**  \nAfter having identified relevant data sources and information in the previous week, you will analyze your findings this week. You will work to combine, aggregate and analyze information from various sources and try to find the most appropriate way to present your insights. As in the previous module you have the opportunity to share your work by handing in a one-page description and four graphical representations of your findings. This assignment is again optional, yet provides a great opportunity to receive feedback that can help you to improve your final project.  \n  \n**Milestone III – Interpretation and Synthesis**  \nIn this module you will interpret and relate your findings from the last two modules to the theoretical concepts you have learned throughout the three specialization courses. This ideally leads to additional insights for answering the analyzed question. If you are interested in receiving feedback, you have the option to hand in a two-page interpretation of your findings, in which you relate them to relevant theoretical concepts.   \n  \n**Write and Finalize your Final Report**  \nIn the fifth week, you will work on and finalize your final assignment. Based on your work from the previous weeks you will write a consulting report for the partner company and develop recommendations for them on how to deal with the specific question at hand. In this week, there is no additional quiz or voluntary peer-review as you should focus on working on your final report that is due in the next week.   \n  \n**Submit your Final Report and Learn from Your Peers**  \nIn this final module, you will submit your final report and review the reports submitted by your peers.The submission of the final assignment is compulsory for passing the course. The final assignment is a report for the company that summarizes your in-depth research on the question, analysis and interpretation. After the summary of the project, the report is supposed to give recommendations for the company on how to deal with the investigated issue. The final report is supposed to comprise ten pages. Additionally, 3-6 graphical representations or tables of the findings must be attached to the report. After you have submitted your report, you will be asked to review reports from your peers. This will allow you to see different approaches to analyze the same question and will be an excellent opportunity to gather ideas for your future projects.\n\n"", ""workload"": null, ""published"": false, ""subtitles"": [""en""], ""video_url"": null, ""course_name"": ""Competitive Strategy and Organization Design Project"", ""description"": ""This industry project is designed to allow you to apply the knowledge you have gained throughout the specialization for advising a real company.

Be sure to read all the information carefully and plan accordingly. Once you have a clear idea of what type of project you want to submit, you will be required to submit a peer-review assignment where you define your project for your peers.  \n  \n**Identify Your Project Goals**  \nThe second stage of the capstone project is to identify your project goals and then provide two questions for feedback from your peers. When submitting your assignment for this week’s milestone, please include all your prior assignment information so that peer reviewers can reference them when evaluating.   \n  \n**Create a Project Outline and Plan**  \nThe third stage of the capstone project is to create a detailed project outline to help you plan the execution of your project. By the end of this module, you should fee ready to begin your project as you will have identified the major tasks needed to accomplish your project, and you will have broken down the smaller tasks needed to achieve your larger goals. When submitting your assignment for this week’s milestone, please include all your prior assignment information so that peer reviewers can reference them when evaluating.   \n  \n**(Optional) Feedback Peer Review**  \nThroughout this capstone course, you’ve had a few opportunities to provide and receive what we hope has been constructive feedback from your peers. Some of the feedback you've received from your peers will seem immediately right, some more challenging to address. At this stage of the course, it is time to engage your metacognition skills and to begin incorporating the feedback you found most helpful from your peers. You will then rework your previous submissions and use that feedback to inform your final project submission. By the end of this module you should have a clear idea of how you'd like to execute your project. Since this Milestone is broad, optional, and allows everyone to resubmit all of their work thus far, you'll have the opportunity to see what your peers who have chosen different lesson tracks from yours have done!   \n  \n**Submit Your Project Draft**  \nWe hope you found the last module, which focused on revising your work based on previous feedback, to be helpful. Now it is time to take that work a step forward by submitting a draft of your final project. Perhaps your project was to write a song and you're ready to submit a version of you singing it. Or maybe you set out to create a plan for some sort of sustainable living innovation, here, you’ll get to show everyone what that might look like in your community. Some of you may be thinking about creating a workshop or a lesson plan based on Journey of the Universe; now, you get to show us how that might look in a classroom setting.   \n  \n**Submit Your Final Project!**  \nThis is the last step in our Capstone project.

 In this installment, Douglas discusses the importance of developing a sense of photographic vision: keeping your mind and eye open for photographic opportunities, and maximizing those opportunities through composition and other creative decisions. The course begins with Douglas reviewing images from his personal collection. He discusses the importance of observation and exploration for a photographer, how to see art in everyday situations, and why one should always have a camera nearby.  
  
 Douglas then goes on location to shoot in and around Korakia Pensione, a resort in Palm Springs, California. He explains his creative and technical decisions as he shoots, and describes how natural lines created by architecture and light can help make an effective photograph. The course continues on a hike through a Palm Springs canyon, where Douglas captures images in the field, working with moving water, highly textured rock faces, and even some local wildlife. Finally, Douglas wanders through downtown Palm Springs armed with a simple point-and-shoot camera, proving that with vision and an open mind, great images can be made with simplest equipment.

Il corso comprende anche una introduzione alle tecniche di analisi statistiche con cui è possibile trovare risposte agli interrogativi iniziali formulati in sede di disegno  \ndella ricerca.  \n  \n  \nTo achieve this, we need to understand the importance of research methodology, and this is not immediately obvious to people reading a sociology book, or even to students starting their Social Sciences course. This MOOC, therefore, looks at logic and the scientific approach and how it is applied to the Social Sciences. The objective is to enable students to learn how to set up and implement an empirical study, including the right choice of instruments for data collection according to the specific study, and how to construct and administer them. The course also provides an introduction to statistical analysis which enables us to answer the questions that were set when the research was designed.\n\n"", ""free_content"": true, ""paid_content"": false, ""provider_name"": ""edX"", ""aggregator_url"": ""https://www.class-central.com/course/edx-come-fare-ricerca-nelle-scienze-sociali-12124"", ""page_version_id"": ""f8c3890c-c670-11e8-a9ce-22000b620271""}",{},67ab92aa-c65e-11e8-a86b-22000b620271,2018-10-02 19:46:51,2018-12-03 14:39:13,6,,,,

Основная цель данного мини-модуля – сориентировать вас на тему того, будет ли наш курс вам интересен, и объяснить, какие инструменты вам потребуются для его успешного прохождения.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\nПоследовательные функции\n\n \n\nВ этом модуле вы научитесь как создавать простые последовательные функции, так и использовать (вызывать) уже имеющийся код. Кроме того, вы узнаете о том, что такое типы и выражения, и как важно давать всему правильные имена.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 2**\n\n \n\nВетвления\n\n \n\nДанный модуль познакомит вас с такой штукой как ветвления – специальные операторы, позволяющие управлять тем, какой код должен выполняться в зависимости от заданного условия. Также вы узнаете, как можно описывать эти самые условия при помощи логических функций.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 3**\n\n \n\nРекурсии и циклы\n\n \n\nВ программировании часто возникают ситуации, когда один и тот же код необходимо выполнить не один, а несколько раз. В этом модуле мы расскажем вам о двух способах, какими это можно сделать, – рекурсии и циклах, – и немного сравним их между собой.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 4**\n\n \n\nСписки и строки\n\n \n\nСтруктуры данных – одна из обязательных составляющих любой более-менее сложной программы. В данном модуле мы познакомимся со списками --- одной из самых простых, но вместе с тем полезной структурой данных, – а также их лучшими друзьями строками и массивами. В последнем видео мы сделаем небольшой шаг в сторону и обсудим такую вещь, как функции высших порядков, – способ описывать операции над списками декларативно, – и их плюсы и минусы.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 5**\n\n \n\nАссоциативные массивы и множества\n\n \n\nК часто встречающимся структурам данных, помимо списков, относятся ассоциативные массивы и множества. В данном модуле мы обсудим то, какие возможности они предоставляют программистам и какие реальные объекты напоминают. В последнем видео мы снова сделаем отступление и поговорим про такой объект как null: что он собой представляет, почему он нужен, какие безопасные и не очень способы работы с ним есть.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 6**\n\n \n\nСтроковый ввод-вывод\n\n \n\nДля общения с пользователем в программировании могут использоваться различные механизмы, от строго заданной web-формы до разговора в свободной форме в чате. Самым простым механизмом является консольный ввод-вывод, с которым мы и познакомимся в данном модуле. Кроме непосредственно ввода-вывода мы также обсудим вопросы разбора текстовых данных и то, как в языке Котлин обрабатываются ошибки.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 7**\n\n \n\nРабота с файлами\n\n \n\nЕще одним способом общения с внешним миром в программировании являются файлы. В этом модуле мы поговорим о том, как в языке Котлин можно работать (читать/записывать) с файлами, и попытаемся объединить все, изученное ранее, на нескольких практических примерах.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\nЗаключение\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n"", ""workload"": 4, ""published"": false, ""subtitles"": [""ru""], ""video_url"": null, ""course_name"": ""Введение в язык Котлин"", ""description"": ""Всем привет!

https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-valuation-and-strategy,"Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital",Coursera,business,[],"Hi and welcome to this course!   
   
 Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions? Then 'Valuation and Strategy' by Erasmus University Rotterdam is the right course for you! This course is helpful for executives that need to value complete strategies and for all students interested in corporate finance and strategy. We present the latest tools and show you how to apply them!  
   
 We will revolutionize your way of decision making, by extending static techniques from corporate finance with dynamic methods to quantify strategic thinking. Traditionally, we assess the attractiveness of an investment as a mature business, where future cash flows mainly result from past decisions. But, in an ever-changing world, strategic decisions determine the firm’s long-term success and market value. Yet managers often have to consider these long-term implications using intuition and experience alone, with little guidance from structured, quantitative analysis.  
   
 Our treatment goes far beyond the use of standard valuation analysis. We introduce the expanded NPV, which brings together DCF, real options, and game theory. Thinking in terms of options, games, and adaptive strategies may help managers address strategic questions such as: How do you value a leveraged buyout? How can you value a high-tech venture with negative cash flows? When should you invest in new ventures in stages? How can you incorporate rival bidders in the analysis?  
   
 The tools we provide can improve your decisions in business and in daily life.  
   
 \* Who is this class for?  
 We hope that our course appeals to (graduate) students in finance, economics, and business, as well as to high-ranking professionals and a general audience. This course is particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, CFOs, and those who aspire these affiliations. We offer this MOOC at 3 levels:  
   
 1.Executive Summary:   
 This 1-week module provides critical insights into the principles of corporate valuation and strategy. This is accessible for time-constrained executives and the general audience without any prior knowledge.  
   
 2. Student Level:  
 This level involves an understanding of the technical details. This level requires basic knowledge of concepts in corporate finance, e.g., the time value of money, capital structure, and the relation between risk and returns. Learners of this level can skip week 1.  
   
 3. Honors Level (honors certificate):   
 This level is challenging, engaging, and compelling to an intellectually rigorous student.

My name is Han Smit, I am Professor of Corporate Finance at Erasmus School of Economics. I will be your lecturer, and together with my team, Dyaran Bansraj and Nishad Matawlie, we are going to take you on a fascinating journey that may change the way you make strategic investment decisions. This executive level&nbsp;course&nbsp;consists of a series of accessible animation videos. Step by step we develop the conceptual frameworks and new valuation principles for strategic investments that are difficult to value with traditional tools. These new valuation methods can be particularly interesting for venture capitalists, private equity investors, investment bankers, CEOs, and CFOs.&nbsp;This executive level&nbsp;course&nbsp;is meant for those who want to be updated on the latest insights&nbsp;in corporate strategy&nbsp;and valuation techniques.&nbsp;You can walk through the fundamentals of the course in less than a week! If you wish to follow the student level, you can skip this week (don't worry, you won't miss out on anything)!\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 2**\n\n \n\nDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis\n\n \n\nWe show you how to apply DCF approaches and provide case applications illustrating the powerful potential of this valuation methodology. We consider historical analysis, the estimation of free cash flows, various DCF approaches, and multiples valuation. In the assignments we consider specialized topics such as the valuation of leveraged buyouts. After this module you will be familiar with DCF approaches and will be able to relate them to strategy.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 3**\n\n \n\nCorporate Strategy\n\n \n\nThis module closes the gap between traditional corporate finance and strategic planning by linking corporate strategy to the market value. We can assess the value of a company through the expanded NPV criterion, which is able to capture the value of the firm's growth options. We review various strategic paradigms that analyze the underlying sources of this growth option value, focusing on industry analysis, firms' internal resources and dynamic capabilities. After this module you will be able to recognise the strategic growth option value in the market value of a company.\n\n \n\n**&nbsp;**\n\n \n\n**WEEK 4**\n\n \n\nCorporate Real Options\n\n \n\nThis module reviews the basic concepts and valuation principles of real options. Real options theory quantifies decision making under uncertainty and stresses the importance of wait-and-see flexibility, suggesting that managers should wait until major uncertainties are resolved and the project is more clearly beneficial. Since it recognizes that investments tend to be sequentially related over time, real options analysis is particularly suitable for valuing strategies in addition to isolated projects. After this module you will be able to quantify the flexibility component of the strategic growth option value. This is an important capability when valuing high-tech companies.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n \n\n**WEEK 5**\n\n \n\nOption Games\n\n \n\nThis module provides an overview of the basic principles of game theory, which are essential for our understanding of strategic decisions. Strategic investment decisions are often made in a context in which decision makers must consider the deliberate (re)actions of rivals. Combining real options with games helps us to understand competitive behavior under uncertainty. Practical examples of option games include: competitive bidding in acquisitions and new product development decisions (in car manufacturing, mobile phones and consumer electronics). After this module you will be able to quantify the strategic component in the strategic growth option value. This is important for understanding strategic decisions of companies with high growth option value.\n\n \n\n&nbsp;\n\n"", ""workload"": 4, ""published"": false, ""subtitles"": [""en""], ""video_url"": null, ""course_name"": ""Advanced Valuation and Strategy - M&A, Private Equity, and Venture Capital"", ""description"": ""Hi and welcome to this course!   \n   \n Would you like to learn about the latest valuation methods that may help you to make better business decisions?

Chaque jour, dans les territoires, les problématiques d’accès au numérique changent de visage. Ce n’est plus seulement l’accès à une connexion ou à un équipement qui compte, c’est aussi l’usage que l’on sait en faire dans tous les aspects de la vie quotidienne.

 

Or si les transitions numériques s’accélèrent, les écarts d’usage se creusent. Aujourd’hui, 13 millions de Français restent en difficulté avec le numérique. L'acquisition d’une culture numérique et de compétences numériques, à tout âge, n’a pourtant jamais été aussi essentielle pour devenir pleinement citoyen de la société numérique.

 

Les collectivités territoriales ont un rôle essentiel à jouer en la matière, pour mobiliser leur territoire autour de ces grands enjeux d’inclusion numérique, d’encapacitation citoyenne et de développement économique. Cette implication des collectivités territoriales se fait notamment dans le cadre des maisons de service au public.

 

Pour vous accompagner dans cette démarche, le CNFPT et la MEDNUM se sont associés pour vous proposer une formation à distance qui a pour objet de vous donner les clefs de lecture pour agir.
