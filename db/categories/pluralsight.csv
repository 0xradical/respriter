Barnard, and I’d like to introduce you to my course, Building a Better Business Case-Building a Better Business. 

I’m a certified management consultant and CEO of Explorus Group Inc. I’ve spent my life helping global organizations manage their never-ending change. 

The best tool used by organizations around the world to introduce change is the formal document called a “Business Case.” 

In this course, we’ll look at some of the essential components to building an effective business case by focusing on the things that you’ll rarely hear about in business management training. 

Some of the major topics we’ll cover include: 
1.	Tying the Business Case to project management 
2.	Leveraging a business case triage 
3.	Framing your business case scope to optimize value to the organization 
4.	Standardizing your approach to risk management x26 
5.	Applying international best practices when developing metrics for your business case 

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to build an amazing business case that provides value, frames the right scope and helps decision makers understand risks, complexity and forecasted benefits. 

This is an advanced course that benefits from at least a basic understanding of the organization from an enterprise level, along with business analysis and project management experience.  

I hope you’ll join me on this adventure to learn more about the art and science of creating an exemplary business case, with Building a Better Business Case-Building a Better Business at Pluralsight.
