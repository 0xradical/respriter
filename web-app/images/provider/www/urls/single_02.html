If you feel anger is taking over your life, remember than that it is not only you who suffers from that, it is your family, friends and all the people around you who loves you.

I say that because I've been through many books and courses on the subject of Anger Management. I found this course to be insightful, easy to follow and usable. Ken lays out a philosophical framework but takes care to add practical application all the way through. I actually found myself fascinated at times by his descriptions of the processes by which we become angry.
