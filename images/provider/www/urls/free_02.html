Most people think that getting into this business requires some type of connections, special education, business licenses, and permits. This is the furthest thing from the truth. Anyone can get into the jewelry business. The jewelry business is safer than ANY other business on the planet. It is easier and SAFER than businesses such as drop shipping, buying items from china and reselling them on amazon, etc. Why? because you are dealing with real gold and diamonds which is basically real currency and can be melted, reused, or sold at any time. You can make jewelry pieces for under $100 and sell them for 100-400 percent profits. You will learn everything from how jewelry is made, to where to buy diamonds, to the strategies of how to build a profitable business and much much more. I have been in this business for years and will teach you everything you need to know about this business.</p>",
