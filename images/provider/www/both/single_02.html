        "description": "<p>God helps those who help themselves. Self help is the best help. One must at all times try to support oneself and not rely on other people to come and assist. One should have faith that our problem will be solved through some external forces, or good person or God. This course explains without losing hope how to conquer obstacles that present before oneâ€™s life. Course includes many modules, such as what is meditation, Concept of Mediation, Pre-requisites for meditation, Preparation before meditation, various types of Guided Meditation pieces, what is Spiritual Awakening, the power of prayer &amp;more. In detail, you will see that these modules are inter-connected. Though I already tried to cover almost all the subjects related to spirituality, I want you to do more research on it from your side with your unique perspective and vision. If you will go detail in each subject you will have more urge to know about that subject. When you will start this subject I want you to sit with pen &amp; paper is your effective tool which you require before start this course. Trust on your Spirtual Teacher &amp; on your own intuition is the key to unlock your hidden potential! All the best!! </p>",
